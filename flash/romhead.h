 *
 *	Special ROM header
 *	==================
 *	The System ROM can contain multiple ROM images, each with
 *	its own header. That header tells the SROM where to load
 *	the image and also if it has been compressed with the
 *	"makerom" tool.  For System ROMs which contain a single
 *	image, the header is optional.  If the header does not
 *	exist the complete System ROM is loaded and executed at
 *	physical address zero.

 *
 *	VALIDATION PATTERN
 *	------------------
 *	The first quadword contains a special signature pattern
 *	that is used to verify that this "special" ROM header
 *	has been located.  The pattern is 0x5A5AC3C3A5A53C3C.
 *
 *	HEADER SIZE (Bytes)
 *	-------------------
 *	The header size is the next longword.  This is provided
 *	to allow for some backward compatibility in the event that
 *	the header is extended in the future.  When the header
 *	is located, current versions of SROM code determine where
 *	the image begins based on the header size.  Additional data
 *	added to the header in the future will simply be ignored
 *	by current SROM code. Additionally, the header size = 0x20
 *	implies version 0 of this header spec.  For any other size
 *      see HEADER REVISION to determine header version.
 *      
 *      
 *	IMAGE CHECKSUM
 *	--------------
 *	The next longword contains the image checksum.  This is
 *	used to verify the integrity of the ROM.  Checksum is computed
 *      in the same fashion as the header checksum.
 *
 *	IMAGE SIZE (Memory Footprint)
 *	-----------------------------
 *	The image size reflects the size of the image after it has
 *	been loaded into memory from the ROM. See ROM IMAGE SIZE.
 *
 *	DECOMPRESSION FLAG
 *	------------------
 *	The decompression flag tells the SROM code if the makerom
 *	tool was used to compress the ROM image with a "trivial
 *	repeating byte algorithm".  The SROM code contains routines
 *	which perform this decompression algorithm.  Other
 *	compression/decompression schemes may be employed which work
 *	independently from this one.
 *
 *	DESTINATION ADDRESS
 *	-------------------
 *	This quadword contains the destination address for the
 *	image.  The SROM code  will begin loading the image at this
 *	address and subsequently begin its execution there.
 *
 *	HEADER REV
 *	----------
 *	The revision of the header specifications used in this
 *	header.  This is necessary to provide compatibility to
 *	future changes to this header spec.  Version 0 headers
 *	are identified by the size of the header.  See HEADER
 *	SIZE.
 *
 *	FIRMWARE ID
 *	-----------
 *	The firmware ID is a byte that specifies the firmware type.
 *	This facilitates image boot options necessary to boot
 *	different operating systems.
 *
 *		  firmware
 *	firmware    type
 *	--------  --------
 *	  DBM	     0	     Alpha Evaluation Boards Debug Monitor
 *	  WNT        1       Windows NT Firmware
 *	  SRM        2       Alpha System Reference Manual Console
 *
 *	ROM IMAGE SIZE
 *	--------------
 *	The ROM image size reflects the size of the image as it is
 *	contained in the ROM. See IMAGE SIZE.
 *
 *	OPTIONAL FW ID
 *	--------------
 *	This is an optional field that can be used to provide
 *	additional firmware information such as firmware revision
 *	or a character descriptive string up to 8 characters.
 *
 *	HEADER CHECKSUM
 *	---------------
 *	The checksum of the header.  This is used to validate
 *	the presence of a header beyond the validation provided
 *	by the validation pattern.  See VALIDATION PATTERN.
 *	The header checksum is computed from the beginning of
 *	the header up to but excluding the header checksum
 *	field itself.  If there are future versions of this
 *	header the header checksum should always be the last
 *	field defined in the header.  The checksum algorithm used
 *	is compatible with the standard BSD4.3 algorithm provided
 *	on most implementations of Unix.  Algorithm: The checksum
 *	is rotated right by one bit around a 16 bit field before
 *	adding in the value of each byte.
