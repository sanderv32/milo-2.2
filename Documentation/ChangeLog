    vector dummies to build smaller specific milos against generic
    kernels. (Should be put ifdef CONFIG_ALPHA_GENERIC)
  * got rid of some kernel dependencies.
  * Builds cleanly against 2.2.14 and 2.2.15pre kernels.
  * only have alpha_use_srm stuff, when compiling against ag generic
    kernel.
