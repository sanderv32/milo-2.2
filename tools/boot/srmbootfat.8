.TH srmboot 8
.SH NAME
srmbootfat, srmbootraw \- SRM boot block composers
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B srmbootfat
.I filesystem_image boot_file
.br
.B srmbootraw
.I boot_device boot_file
.SH DESCRIPTION
These tools are quick hacks and are not supposed to exist in their present
state for long.

.B Srmbootfat
finds
.I boot_file
in the root directory of the FAT filesystem stored in file
.I filesystem_image
and makes it bootable by writing the appropriate SRM boot block into the
filesystem image file.  This will work only on unpartitioned disks (such as
floppies), because otherwise the boot block would need to be written into the
partition table, which is outside the filesystem.  However, a hard drive
containing a FAT filesystem would most probably be partitioned using the PC
partition table, which SRM cannot boot from anyway.

The bootloader
.RI ( boot_file )
must be contiguous, i.e. occupy consecutive blocks.

.B Srmbootraw
writes the image from
.I boot_file
preceded by the appropriate SRM boot block into the first blocks of
.IR boot_device ,
preserving the disklabel.  It is intended to be used when you have a small raw
partition at the beginning of your hard drive, dedicated for the bootloader.
If you don't,
.B srmbootraw
will silently render your filesystem(s) unusable.
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.B filesystem_image
The name of the file containing a FAT filesystem image, e.g. /dev/fd0.
.TP
.B boot_file
The bootloader's file name.
.TP
.B boot_device
The device you intend to boot from, e.g. /dev/sda.  It must have enough room
at the beggining to hold the boot block and the bootloader.
